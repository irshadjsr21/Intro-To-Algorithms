# Fractional Knapsack Problem

Given weights (say `w`) and values (say `v`) of `n` items, we need to put these
items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

Note that we can break an item and take a fraction of the item in the knapsack.

Example:

```
v = [ 60, 100, 120]
w = [ 10, 20, 30 ]
W = 50

Ans = 240
```
