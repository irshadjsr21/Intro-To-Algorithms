# Rod Cutting

Given a rod of length `n` inches and a table of prices `p` for `i = 1, 2, . . . . n`, determine
the maximum revenue `r` obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if
the price p[n] for a rod of length `n` is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting
at all.

Example:

```
p = [ 1, 5, 8, 9, 10 , 17, 17, 20, 24, 30]
r = 30
```
