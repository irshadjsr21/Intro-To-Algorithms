# 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of `n` items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to
get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

In other words, given two integer arrays `v[0..n-1]` and `w[0..n-1]` which represent
values and weights associated with `n` items respectively. Also given an integer `W`
which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such
that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot
break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Example:

```
v = [ 60, 100, 120]
w = [ 10, 20, 30 ]
W = 50

Ans = 220
```
